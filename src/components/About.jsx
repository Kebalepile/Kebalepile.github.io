        I have been working as a freelance designer and web developer since
        2018. Iâ€™ve always been someone who has both a creative and a logical
        side. When I discovered web development in university, I realized it
        would be the perfect fit. I could use my creative side to design and my
        logical side to code. As a bonus, being both designer and developer
        allows me to make sure no detail is lost in translation.
